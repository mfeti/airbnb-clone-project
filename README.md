## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack application replicating the core features of Airbnb. It allows users to register, list properties, make bookings, write reviews, and process payments — all while learning professional software development practices.  

**🎯 Project Goals**  
- Learn collaborative development using **Git/GitHub**  
- Gain experience with **backend + frontend integration**  
- Build a **scalable database and secure APIs**  
- Practice **CI/CD & DevOps workflows**

## 🗄️ Database Design  

**Entities & Fields:**  

- 👤 **Users** → id, name, email, password (hashed), role  
- 🏠 **Properties** → id, user_id, title, description, location, price_per_night  
- 📅 **Bookings** → id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price  
- ⭐ **Reviews** → id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment  
- 💳 **Payments** → id, booking_id, amount, status, transaction_date  

**Relationships:**  
- A **user** can own many properties  
- A **property** can have many bookings & reviews  
- A **booking** is linked to one user and one property  
- A **payment** is tied to a single booking  

---

## ⚙️ Feature Breakdown  

- 👤 **User Management** – Register/login, profile editing, role handling  
- 🏡 **Property Management** – Hosts list and manage properties with details & pricing  
- 📅 **Booking System** – Guests book properties, system calculates total price  
- ⭐ **Review System** – Guests leave ratings and feedback after stays  
- 💳 **Payments** – Secure online payments with transaction status tracking  
- 🔍 **Search & Filters** – Find properties by price, location, availability  

---

## 🔐 API Security  

- 🔑 **Authentication** → Secure login (JWT/OAuth2)  
- 🛂 **Authorization** → Role-based access (hosts vs. guests)  
- ⏳ **Rate Limiting** → Prevent API abuse & spamming  
- 🧹 **Input Validation** → Prevent SQL injection & XSS  
- 💳 **Payment Security** → Encrypt & comply with financial security standards  

**Why it matters:** Protects sensitive data, prevents fraud, ensures trustworthiness.  

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline  

- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment):** Automates testing, builds, and deployments.  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - 🐙 GitHub Actions – test & deploy workflows  
  - 📦 Docker – consistent environments  
  - ☁️ Cloud Deployment (AWS / Heroku / DigitalOcean)  

**✅ Benefits:** Faster dev cycle, fewer bugs, consistent deployments.
